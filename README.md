This fork is me trying out the awesome project made by [datamimi](https://github.com/datamimi/morse). All credits to the original author

### What I used?

- Arduino Micro
- [Morse key](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07FBTRMXQ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apap_p94xlQQ7NbRkr)

### Observations

Still a bit buggy, not sure why. Maybe should try with QMK firmware instead.

### Learnings(Satire)

- I suck at morse(not satire, true)
- Use Cherry MX Blues next time
