// Code for a Teensy USB Morse Keyboard

This repo contains code to use a Teensy 3.2 connected to a physical morse key
as a USB keyboard.

I'm using a configuration where one pin of my morse key is connected to pin 7 of
the Teensy (and the other is connected to a ground pin) but pretty much any pin
will work.
